Plethora-Fabric is a port of [Plethora](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/plethora) for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) 
1.19+ and [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-tweaked). Most features have been ported over 1:1. There
are a few minor API changes (mainly to ensure consistency with modern CC: Tweaked).

[[toc]]

## Features ported

- Block scanner
- Entity sensor
- Frickin' laser beam
- Introspection modules
- Kinetic augment
- Manipulator
- Neural interface
- Overlay glasses
- Redstone integrator
- Keyboard module

## Not yet implemented

- Computers in minecarts
- Documentation exporter

#### TODO meta providers:
- Tool harvest level
- Daylight Detector
- Sculk Sensor
- Mob Spawner
- Spawn egg

## Gameplay changes

- Block scanner and Entity sensor upgrades now require Netherite as well as Nether Stars to craft
- Block scanners, when held in your hand, now show accurate colors for ore blocks
  - All the new ore types (copper, deepslate ore, nether ores, etc.) are supported
  - Entity colors are still "random" but can be changed in the config file
- Keyboards can no longer be 'bound' to computers. Instead, computers can be right-clicked from up to 32 blocks away
  (shift-right-click if they are within the normal reach range) to open the keyboard GUI. They still work the same as
  a neural interface module, forwarding all key events while in-game.
- Neural interfaces no longer work on mobs.
- The following vanilla modules have been removed:
  - Note Blocks - use CC: Tweaked's Speakers instead
  - Clock - use `os.clock()` and `os.day()` instead
  - Daylight Detector

:::

#### Inventory methods

Inventory methods have been renamed to be more consistent with CC: Tweaked:

- `getItemMeta` -> `getItemDetail`
- `size` -> `getSize`
- `getItemLimit` has been added
- `drop`, `suck` are <NYI/>
- `turtle.getItemDetail()` and CC `inventory.getItemDetail()` methods now return rich item metadata provided by Plethora
- `turtle.getInventory()` introspection method has been removed in favor of the native inventory methods
- The hardcoded `inventory` and `ender_chest` transfer locations are not available (see 
  [CC-Tweaked#731](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/issues/731)). Instead, use a bound introspection module to 
  push and pull from `getInventory()`, `getEquipment()` and `getEnder()`.
- `getItem()` and `getItem().setActive()` have been removed

For the player inventory *only* (`getInventory()` with an introspection module):

- `getInventory().getItem(slot).consume()` has been changed to `getInventory().consume(slot)`
- `getInventory().getItem(slot).drop([limit, [direction]])` has been changed to 
  `getInventory().drop(slot, [limit, [direction]])`

#### Meta changes

- Player meta fields <NYI/>: `isFlying`, `allowFlying`, `walkSpeed`, `flySpeed`
- Block meta fields <NYI/>: `harvestLevel`, `harvestTool`, `metadata`
- Enchantment names are slightly different (e.g. `enchantment.oxygen` -> `minecraft:respiration`)

#### Overlay glasses

- `canvas3d().addLine` is <NYI/>
- `canvas2d().addItem`'s `damage` argument has been removed
- `canvas3d().addItem`'s `damage` argument has been removed
- 3D items cannot currently have their depth test toggled - they are always depth tested by default. But, you can put
  the items in a frame (`canvas3d().addFrame()`) and then toggle the depth test on the frame.
