**Effective December 28, 2022.**

This privacy policy (the “**Privacy Policy**”) describes how SwitchCraft 3 (“**SwitchCraft**,” “**SC3**,” “**we**,” or
“**us**”) collects, uses and discloses personal information (“**Personal Information**”) about you when you visit any of
the websites owned or operated by SwitchCraft (collectively, the “**Sites**”), connect to any of our Minecraft servers
(collectively, the “**Servers**”), or when you otherwise interact with us.

Other websites and providers may follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to
them, such as third-party mods included installed on your client or provided by us in our modpack, or the platform you
may use to communicate with us such as Discord. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of other
websites you visit before providing your information to them.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make substantial changes, we will notify you by revising the
date at the top of this Privacy Policy and adding a notice to the #announcements channel in our
[Discord](https://discord.sc3.io) server. If you use the Servers after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been
posted, that means you agree to all the changes.

The Sites and Servers are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from
anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to use the Site or Servers or send any Personal
Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we
will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal
Information, please contact us at <privacy@sc3.io>.
